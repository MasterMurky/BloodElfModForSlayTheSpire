# Blood Elf Mod

This is a mod for the video game **Slay the Spire** developed and published by [Mega Crit](https://www.megacrit.com/).  
It introduces:

- One new character
- X new character cards
- Y character relics
- Z potions

The mod will be available on the Steam Workshop. I will add the link once it is released.
